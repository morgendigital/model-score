# ‚≠ê Model Score

**--------- ATTENTION ----------**
*This repo is work in progress!*

The **Model Score** is a proposal to an open-source rating system that evaluates LLMs (large language models) based on a variety of criteria. It aims to provide accurate quantitative measures to compare different language models and assessing their capabilities. It also aims to help with legal compliance of an AI model, based on regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act.

Contributions for improving the Model Score are welcome! Commit your ideas to the [Model Score repository on Github](https://github.com/morgendigital/model-score).

# Evaluation Criteria
Here, we are currently collecting ideas on what to track. Each evaluation point needs to be examined further in more detail.

## Scoring Model
