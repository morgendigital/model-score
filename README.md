# ‚≠ê Model Score
The **Model Score** is an open-source rating system to evaluate LLMs (large language models) based on a variety of criteria. It's intended to provide accurate quantitative measures to compare different language models and their capabilities.

It also aims to help estimating the regulatory compliance of a model, by e.g. automatically trying to score compliance with different compliance rule sets like the EU AI Act.
